## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher
- **Maven**: Version 3.6+
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-compatible IDE

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jonnerop/Queue-Simulator/tree/main
   cd Queue-Simulator
   ```

2. **Build the Project**: Use Maven to clean and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: Use your IDE to execute `Main.java`, or run via Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"
   ```

4. **Testing**: Run tests with Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
